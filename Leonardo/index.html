            <h2>Leonardo Da Vinci</h2>
            <p><span>L</span>eonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas
              of _ interest included invention, drawing, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics,
              engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has
              been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and he is widely
              considered one of the greatest painters of all time.
            </p>
            <p>Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity. He conceptualised flying machines, a type of
              armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, an adding machine, and the double hull.</p>
            <p>The catalog presents the most successful of his military inventions.</p>

              <h3>What is Leonardo da Vinci best known for?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci was an artist and engineer who is best known for his paintings, notably the (c.
                1503–19) and the (1495–98).
                His drawing of the Vitruvian Man (c. 1490) has also become a cultural icon. Leonardo is sometimes
                credited as the inventor of
                the tank, helicopter, parachute, and flying machine, among other vehicles and devices, but later
                scholarship has disputed such
                claims. Nonetheless, Leonardo's notebooks reveal a sharp intellect, and his contributions to art,
                including methods of representing
                space, three-dimensional objects, and the human figure, cannot be overstated.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="2" class="tabcontent">
              <h3>How many Leonardo da Vinci paintings are there?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci's total output in painting is really rather small; there are less than 20 surviving
                paintings that can
                be definitely attributed to him, and several of them are unfinished. Two of his most important works—the
                Battle of Anghiari
                and the Leda, neither of them completed—have survived only in copies.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="3" class="tabcontent">
              <h3>What was Leonardo da Vinci’s personality like?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci was described as having a gracious but reserved personality and an elegant bearing.
                He was known to be
                fastidious in personal care, keeping a beard neat and trim in later age, and to dress in colorful
                clothing in styles that
                dismissed current customs. The 16th-century writer Giorgio Vasari indicated that Leonardo cared little
                for money but was
                very generous toward his friends and assistants. He had an exceedingly inquisitive mind and made
                strenuous efforts to become
                erudite in languages, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, and history, among other subjects. The
                writings in his notebooks
                suggest that he may have been a vegetarian, and there is also some speculation that he may have been
                homosexual.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="4" class="tabcontent">
              <h3>What was Leonardo da Vinci’s family like?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci's parents were unmarried at the time of his birth near a small village named Vinci in
                the Tuscan region.
                His father, Ser Piero, was a Florentine notary and landlord, and his mother, Caterina, was a young
                peasant woman who shortly
                thereafter married an artisan. Leonardo grew up on his father's family's estate, where he was treated as
                a “legitimate” son
                and received the usual elementary education of the day: reading, writing, and arithmetic. Leonardo never
                married, but he had
                many close relationships with other artists and intellectuals as well as with his assistants.</p>

              <h3>Who was Leonardo apprenticed to?</h3>
              <p>When Leonardo was about 15, his father, who enjoyed a high reputation in the Florentine community,
                apprenticed him to
                artist Andrea del Verrocchio . In Verrocchio's renowned workshop Leonardo received multifaceted training
                that included
                painting and sculpture as well as the technical-mechanical arts. He also worked in the next-door
                workshop of artist
                Antonio Pollaiuolo , a sculptor, painter, engraver, and goldsmith, who frequently worked with his
                brother, Piero.
                In 1472 Leonardo was accepted into the painters' guild of Florence, but he remained in his teacher's
                workshop for five more years,
                after which time he worked independently in Florence until 1481.</p>

              <h3>What is Leonardo da Vinci best known for?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci was an artist and engineer who is best known for his paintings, notably the (c.
                1503–19) and the (1495–98).
                His drawing of the Vitruvian Man (c. 1490) has also become a cultural icon. Leonardo is sometimes
                credited as the inventor of
                the tank, helicopter, parachute, and flying machine, among other vehicles and devices, but later
                scholarship has disputed such
                claims. Nonetheless, Leonardo's notebooks reveal a sharp intellect, and his contributions to art,
                including methods of representing
                space, three-dimensional objects, and the human figure, cannot be overstated.</p>

              <h3>How many Leonardo da Vinci paintings are there?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci's total output in painting is really rather small; there are less than 20 surviving
                paintings that can
                be definitely attributed to him, and several of them are unfinished. Two of his most important works—the
                Battle of Anghiari
                and the Leda, neither of them completed—have survived only in copies.</p>

            <div id="8" class="tabcontent">
              <h3>What was Leonardo da Vinci’s personality like?</h3>
              <p>Leonardo da Vinci was described as having a gracious but reserved personality and an elegant bearing.
                He was known to be
                fastidious in personal care, keeping a beard neat and trim in later age, and to dress in colorful
                clothing in styles that
                dismissed current customs. The 16th-century writer Giorgio Vasari indicated that Leonardo cared little
                for money but was
                very generous toward his friends and assistants. He had an exceedingly inquisitive mind and made
                strenuous efforts to become
                erudite in languages, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, and history, among other subjects. The
                writings in his notebooks
                suggest that he may have been a vegetarian, and there is also some speculation that he may have been
                homosexual.</p>
